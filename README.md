## 🔐 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **MSc in Cyber Security at Sheffield Hallam University** (2025-2027) and have hands-on experience securing both **AWS and Azure cloud environments**. I'm passionate about building security in from the start—especially through **SecDevOps practices**—and integrating it smoothly into the development lifecycle.

I'm actively seeking an **entry-level opportunity** in **Cloud Security, SecDevOps, or a SOC Analyst role** where I can put my technical skills and proactive approach to good use.
